Aziz made some beautiful art, I'm still reeling from watching season two of Master of None. Situations in this season were Kafkaesque, I shuddered with discomfort at the truthfulness of it all. Cringe is good sometimes.

I will hold off on more spoilers but if you're so inclined you should watch this show.

Makes me want to go to Italy. _Alora_.
