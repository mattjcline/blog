## Why is it that a Greenpoint Cocktail calls for Yellow Chartreuse?

#### Jr. Investigative Reporter Matt Cline here to get to the bottom of this coupe.

Ehh... Greenpoint's taste good, I don't mind. Sick lede though, right? If you really want a cocktail that calls for Rye & Green Chartreuse I have the ticket. Just listen to how I found it real quick.

The night Trump was elected I was alone in Boulder, CO. The Boulderado Hotel bar was mostly empty, save a woman in shambles grasping at our nation's current predicament. I needed a cocktail. Something new. A fresh start on this shite evening. Drey The Bartender made me the dankest of the dank rye drinks. Spirit-forward, vegetal, suggestion of citrus. I don't drink much else anymore and I've walked through making this cocktail with many other bartenders in the months since that fateful night. It's also like 4 ingredients so chill out. I'm not good at this, I'm just a bon vivant.

### The Tipperary
 - 1.5 oz. Rye (Templeton)
 - 1 oz. Sweet Vermouth (Dolin)
 - 0.5 oz. Green Chartreuse
 - 3 Dashes Orange Bitters
 - Orange peel

Combine liquids in a bar glass. Stir with ice. Strain into a whiskey glass, coupe, coffee mug, whatever. Squeeze the orange peel like you know what you're doing.

Enjoy it, democracy is a farce.
