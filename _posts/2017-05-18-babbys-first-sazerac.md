I've drunk them before, and been drunk off of them before, but there is something special about making a cocktail for the first time. It's yours, you combined those flavors and you are their beneficiary. Pretty empowering act of creation if you ask me.

The Sazerac was my intro to cocktails after the handful of old fashioned's that my Dad had made me. The Sazerac was the most spirit-forward drink that I had actually enjoyed. I fancied it illicit at the time, while my friends were sipping beers I was effectively drinking sweet, syrupy battery acid. At the time I didn't know much about booze or additives – and I still don't – but what I do know is that upon first sip I felt as if the ripples of Aphrodite's wake were singing to me. The strong scent of rye, anise, and whatever Peychaud's is conjures my memories with fidelity to this day. If humans ever invent a time machine, I hope it's in liquid form.

My favorite Sazerac was made by a bartender at [Craftsman](https://www.yelp.com/biz/craftsman-austin){:target="\_blank"} in Austin, TX. He had just moved from NoLa and had previously won an official-ish sounding Sazerac competition. He maintained that there are a thousand different Sazerac recipes and none of them are wrong. Here's what I did tonight:

### Sazerac
 - 2 oz. Rye (Bulleit)
 - 1 tsp. Cane Sugar
 - Smattering of Peychaud's Bitters
 - Whisp of Pernod (Absinthe is too dang expensive)
 - Lemon peel

 Combine sugar, Peychaud's, and a few drops of water in a mixing glass. Stir until sugar is dissolved.

 Add Rye and much ice. Stir for 30 seconds.

 Add a skosh of Pernod to a chilled rocks glass. Swirl and discard excess Pernod. Preferably into your own mouth.

 Strain the Rye mixture into chilled glass. Add a twist of lemon.
